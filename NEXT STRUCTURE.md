> I think I'll be passing all the emails in one text file to the LLM so that I don't have to make so many calls with context and then I'll get a JSON object back that tells me where to move each email by message ID

#### _Assistant_

> Given that you plan to pass all the email contents as a single text file to the LLM and receive a JSON object with the classification for each email based on the message ID, the structure you described makes sense.
> 
> Here's how you could organize your code:
> 
> 1. **Email Client Module (`email_fetcher/client.py`)**:
>    - Implement a method to fetch all email contents and message IDs from the INBOX.
>    - Optionally, you could preprocess the email contents (e.g., remove signatures, disclaimers) in this module.
> 
> 2. **Text Preparation Module (`utils/text_preparation.py`)**:
>    - Create a function to combine all email contents into a single text file.
>    - Optionally, you could perform additional text preprocessing steps in this module.
> 
> 3. **Language Model Module (`language_model/openai_model.py`)**:
>    - Implement a function to send the combined email text file to the LLM API.
>    - Receive the JSON response from the LLM and return it.
> 
> 4. **Main Application Module (`main.py`)**:
>    - Import and use the necessary functions and classes from the other modules.
>    - Connect to the email server using `EmailClient`.
>    - Fetch all email contents and message IDs from the INBOX.
>    - Combine the email contents into a single text file using the `text_preparation` module.
>    - Send the combined text file to the LLM API using the `language_model` module, and receive the JSON response.
>    - Process the JSON response to determine the classification for each email based on the message ID.
>    - Move the emails to the appropriate folders using the `EmailClient` and the classification results.
>    - Disconnect from the email server.
> 
> Here's an example of how the `main.py` file could look:
> 
> ```python
> # main.py
> from email_fetcher.client import EmailClient
> from utils.text_preparation import combine_email_contents
> from language_model.openai_model import send_text_to_llm
> 
> def main():
>     # Initialize the EmailClient
>     email_client = EmailClient(host="your_email_host", user="your_email_user", password="your_email_password")
> 
>     # Connect to the email server
>     email_client.connect()
> 
>     # Get all email contents and message IDs from the INBOX
>     email_contents, message_ids = email_client.get_all_email_contents_and_ids()
> 
>     # Combine the email contents into a single text file
>     combined_text = combine_email_contents(email_contents)
> 
>     # Send the combined text to the LLM API and get the classification response
>     classification_response = send_text_to_llm(combined_text)
> 
>     # Process the classification response and move the emails accordingly
>     for message_id, classification in classification_response.items():
>         email_client.move_email(message_id, classification)
> 
>     # Disconnect from the email server
>     email_client.disconnect()
> 
> if __name__ == "__main__":
>     main()
> ```
> 
> In this example, the `main.py` file orchestrates the entire process by:
> 
> 1. Initializing the `EmailClient` and connecting to the email server.
> 2. Fetching all email contents and message IDs from the INBOX using the `EmailClient`.
> 3. Combining the email contents into a single text file using the `combine_email_contents` function from the `text_preparation` module.
> 4. Sending the combined text file to the LLM API using the `send_text_to_llm` function from the `language_model` module, and receiving the classification response (assumed to be a JSON object with message IDs as keys and classifications as values).
> 5. Processing the classification response and moving each email to the appropriate folder using the `EmailClient`.
> 6. Disconnecting from the email server.
> 
> Note that you'll need to implement the respective functions and methods in the corresponding modules (`email_fetcher/client.py`, `utils/text_preparation.py`, and `language_model/openai_model.py`) based on your specific requirements and the LLM API you're using.
> 
> This approach separates concerns, making it easier to maintain and test each module independently. Additionally, it allows for flexibility in terms of changing the LLM provider or the text preparation steps in the future without modifying the main application flow.
